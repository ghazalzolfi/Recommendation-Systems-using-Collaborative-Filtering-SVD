# Recommendation Systems using Collaborative Filtering (SVD)

This repository explores recommendation systems through collaborative filtering, specifically focusing on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). It demonstrates a practical implementation of collaborative filtering techniques, effectively predicting user preferences based on historical user-item interactions using the MovieLens dataset.

### Project Overview:

### **1. Collaborative Filtering**
- **Objective**: Recommend items (movies) to users based on similar user preferences.
- **Methods Explained**:
  - Content Filtering (briefly introduced for context): Recommendations based on item features and past user interactions.
  - Collaborative Filtering: Recommendations based on user similarity in terms of behavior (ratings).

### **2. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for Recommendations**
- **Objective**: Apply matrix factorization methods to predict ratings and recommend movies.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Loaded and preprocessed the MovieLens dataset, mapping users and movies to numerical indices.
  - Split data into training and validation sets to ensure generalizability.
  - Applied SVD to factorize user-item rating matrices and predict missing ratings.

### **3. Data Preparation and Preprocessing**
- **Dataset**: MovieLens dataset containing user-movie ratings.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Normalized user and movie identifiers.
  - Managed data splits for unbiased performance evaluation.

### **4. Model Training and Validation**
- **Training Method**:
  - Implemented and optimized the SVD algorithm for rating prediction.
  - Evaluated model performance on the validation dataset, ensuring effectiveness in realistic scenarios.

### **5. Recommendations and Analysis**
- Generated personalized movie recommendations for users.
- Analyzed recommendation quality and performance metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

### Key Learning Outcomes:
- Practical knowledge of recommendation algorithms, particularly collaborative filtering.
- Deep understanding of matrix factorization techniques like SVD in recommender systems.
- Experience in data preprocessing and model evaluation in realistic recommendation tasks.

### Libraries and Tools Used:
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas (Data handling and numerical computations)
- scikit-learn (Model evaluation and data splitting)
- Matplotlib (Visualization)

This project establishes essential skills in recommendation systems, focusing on collaborative filtering methods crucial for various real-world applications, such as e-commerce, streaming platforms, and personalized services.
